Welcome to the NixLab blog. This is where I'll be writing about simulation development, learning design, and the tools I build along the way.

## What to expect

- Deep dives into browser-based physics simulations
- Notes on Moodle course design and LMS architecture
- Technical write-ups on projects like the interactive multimeter and wind tunnel
- Thoughts on making complex topics accessible through interactivity

Stay tuned.
